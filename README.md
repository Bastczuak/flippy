## Flippy

Right now I'm doing the Harvard online course
`CS50's Introduction to Game Development`. I combined this with
learning `Rust` and [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) because I 
personally don't like `Lua` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. This
repo is my version of [Fifty Bird](https://github.com/games50/fifty-bird).
